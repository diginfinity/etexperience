            The ET Application form gives our members the ability to collect information about emerging technologies by providing a way to create challenges and general questionairres. All of the questions are configurable, as is the overall user-experience and style. The documentation below is intended to provide a reference for how to customize the forms for any website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="uk-h3">For members</h2>
        <p>
            To create a new ET Application form, first login to the Member's Admin Area to create new forms. Click "Create a Form", give the form a simple title and description, upon completion, provide the required API_KEY and FORM_ID to your development team who will be implementing the form. Not to worry, you can always get this later by looking at the form summary. Additional information may be found in the <a href="https://iterate-et-app-form-admin-dev.firebaseapp.com/#/faq">Member's Admin Area FAQ</a>.

            This documentation assumes you know the basics of Vue.js, if you're not comfortable with it yet,
            it's probably not the best idea to learn from here as your first step â€” learn the basics then come back.
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> website is the best source for you to start with.
